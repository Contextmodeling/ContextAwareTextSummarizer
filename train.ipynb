            "H: Update on Carl Frampton-Scott^ Quigg...^\n",
            "D: Boxing News was founded in 1909^ by original editor John Murray as, simply, Boxing.^ Murray had been a regular contributor to Health & Strength magazine and convinced its owner, Bill Berry (later^ Lord Camrose)^ to launch a weekly magazine dedicated solely to boxing.^ It is believed Murray had been inspired by Jack Johnson beating Tommy Burns to become the first black World heavyweight champion. In his first editorial,^ Murray stated, \"Boxing^ will stand for good clean sport. Its success of failure is in the hands of those who believe in sport of this character. Our energies will be devoted to giving the best paper that time, thought and money can devise.\"^ When circulation began to decline in the depression days of the late 20s,^ the name of the magazine was changed to Boxing,^ Racing and Football.^ In October 1931,^ the paper was sold to a syndicate of London sportsmen,^ who installed Sydney Rushton,^ a long-time London fight reporter,^ as the new editor. The layout changed, the page size was increased and Rushton^ proved less popular than Murray.^ The paper was again put up for sale and, while waiting for a buyer,^ the old features were reinstated and there was no official Editor.^ Another set of sportsmen^ bought the paper and Godfrey^ Williams was named editor. He attempted to run Boxing as a newspaper, cutting popular features and reducing news stories down to the shortest possible length. The circulation quickly dropped to its lowest ever. Billy Masters,^ a city printer and huge boxing fan, saved the paper, appointing^ W.H.^ Millier^ as the new editor. He completely reinvigorated^ the magazine, helped in no small measure by its first colour cover. In 1935,^ Millier^ departed and the owner replaced him with Sydney Ackland,^ who had previously worked as John Murray's assistant editor and had been taught by him. World War II brought many changes as first Sydney, then replacement Stanley Nelson, contributed to the war effort. Murray made a popular comeback as editor but ill health forced him to step down in 1941.^ Gilbert Odd took over until the building housing the paper was destroyed by the enemy. Odd was then called up for national service and both Masters and Murray served further terms. Now with the new name of Boxing News, the paper was bought by Australian publicist^ Vivian^ Brodzky^ and former promoter Sydney Hulls.^ Northern sports writer Bert Callis^ was the new editor. Odd took over for a second term upon Callis’^ retirement. Odd implemented the tradition of reporting the results and fighters'^ weights for every single fight in the country. When Odd quit to write books, he was succeeded by Jack Wilson and then Tim Riley.^ When Brodzky^ died, Boxing News was sold twice in quick succession,^ and Graham Houston became editor in 1971, immediately broadening the range of coverage, especially in North America. Houston left in 1977 to work on morning newspapers in Canada. This prompted the appointment of perhaps BN's^ greatest Editor of recent years, Harry Mullan.^ Circulation^ increased exponentially during the Mullan^ years, which doubled as a time of great change in the boxing world. Most notable new developments were the proliferation of ‘world’^ titles and the increase in the number of major British promoters.^ Mullan^ was fiercely principled^ and tremendously^ well respected in the boxing fraternity.^ When Mullan^ left in October 1996, he was given this glowing tribute from then BN Publisher^ Peter Kravitz:^ \"His writing stands comparison with the Lieblings,^ Hausers^ and Mailers^ of this century of boxing.\"^ Assistant Editor Claude Abrams succeeded Mullan^ in November 1996. Boxing News was redesigned and switched to a full-colour^ format and become more extensive in content. In March 1999 the paper went to A3 size before reverting^ to A4,^ and increasing in size to 48 pages (from 24)^ in September 2005. The magazine remained the main trade paper in Britain. Abrams left BN – after 22 years – in December 2009, just three months after the publication celebrated its centenary,^ and was succeeded as editor by Tris^ Dixon.^ Tris^ left the magazine in December 2014, with Matt Christie taking over as editor.\n"

            "H: Sheriff:^ Texas man killed by deputies appeared to hold knife\n",
            "D: DALLAS — A second video that captured Texas deputies fatally shooting a man whose hands were raised appears to show that he was holding a knife, a sheriff said Wednesday, declining to release the video because the investigation is still going on. Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said at a news conference that the video has been forwarded to the Texas Department of Public Safety’s^ crime lab to see if the footage can be blown up and slowed down to establish the sequence of Friday’s events. Although it’s unclear from the video what 41-year-old Gilbert Flores may have been holding while facing deputies with his hands up outside of a home near San Antonio, investigators believe it was a knife, she said. “There’s no doubt that what was shown in that video is of grave concern to all of us, but we also want to get this right,”^ Pamerleau said of the investigation, which also involves the FBI.^ She declined to say whether investigators recovered a knife from the scene after the shooting. A separate video taken by a motorist and released publicly shows Flores raise his arms in apparent surrender and stand motionless^ just before the two deputies opened fire, killing him. A utility pole obscured one of his arms in that video, but Pamerleau said the second video, which was taken from a different angle, showed that both of Flores’^ arms were raised when he was shot. “We’re not drawing any conclusions at this point,”^ she said. “That would be inappropriate to do so.”^ The deputies,^ Greg Vasquez^ and Robert Sanchez, have been placed on administrative leave. San Antonio attorney Thomas J. Henry, who is representing the Flores family, previously told The Associated Press that the initial video appears to show that deadly force was unnecessary. “From a lay perspective, seeing the video, it does appear the immediate danger is gone because he had both hands in the air,”^ Henry said. “Now there are other videos and other pieces of evidence that we want to gather.”^ He said the family is considering filing a lawsuit to compel the authorities to turn over more evidence. Juan Contreras,^ president of the Deputy Sheriff’s Association of Bexar County, which is the deputies’^ union, said there are many aspects of the case that haven’t been disclosed by the authorities. “I believe that when the investigation is complete, the members that I represent will be cleared of any wrongdoing,”^ he said in a statement, later adding,^ “I have total confidence in the process and patiently await the outcome of the investigation.”^ Jon Shane,^ a former New Jersey police captain and an associate professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, cautioned that videos of deadly police encounters “almost^ never tell the complete story.”^ He explained that it’s often not immediately apparent what a suspect may have said to officers, whether the suspect may have had more than one weapon or whether the suspect may have been near someone who could have been taken hostage.^ “People seem to have this unwavering sentiment that the video tells the whole story,”^ Shane said. “The reality is that a lot of the time a video raises even more questions.”^ Vasquez^ and Sanchez encountered Flores while responding to a domestic disturbance call. Authorities said they found a woman with a cut and an infant who may have been injured at the home, but they didn’t disclose further details, including the identities of the two or any explanation of how they were hurt. Henry confirmed Wednesday that it was Flores’^ wife and child, but he declined to say whether Flores harmed either of them, only adding that any injuries didn’t result in hospitalization.^ He said any complaints that led to the arrival of deputies “should not have precipitated^ him being shot in the yard.”^ Henry declined to say whether Flores was armed with a knife. “Whether^ he was armed or not armed,^ the issue is going to be whether that scenario was escalating or de-escalating,”^ Henry said. Flores had multiple convictions and had spent 10 years of his life incarcerated,^ according to the San Antonio Express-News.^ Authorities have said deputies used nonlethal^ force in an attempt to subdue^ Flores before the shooting occurred, including the unsuccessful use of a stun gun. Pamerleau said the findings of the investigation will be turned over to the Bexar County district attorney’s^ office for a determination on whether charges will be filed. “We’re working this as diligently and as expeditiously^ as we can,”^ she said.\n"
